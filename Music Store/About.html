        <h3><strong>About Us</strong></h3>
        <p>String players helping other string players sound their best.

            At StringWorks, we believe that every player should have access to the highest quality professional instrument setup - the StringWorks Setup - and the highest quality instruments at their level of performance.  
            
            A family-run founded in Wisconsin and now headquartered in Geneva, Illinois, we are confident that other companies simply can't compete on instrument quality and value - so confident we guarantee it!</p>
<ul>
    <p><strong>Specialists:</strong> We focus only on violins, violas, cellos, bows, and cases, not be distracted by the 1000s of strings, stands, music, and new gadgets and gizmos. </p>
    <p><strong>Value: </strong>We don't haggle, preferring straightforward pricing that always provides tremendous value for comparable products on the market.   </p>
    <p><strong>No Kickbacks:</strong> We don't and never will pay teacher commissions, known as ‘kickbacks’, because we feel it is unfair to the students, to whom full disclosure is not always given. </p>
    <p><strong>Transparency:</strong> We don't inflate prices to allow for absurd amounts of rental credit, "free shipping," or other misleading incentives.  Simply the best quality instruments, always fully carved, professionally setup, and tested by players just like you.   </p>
    <p><strong>Experience:</strong> The people you communicate with at StringWorks are experienced with stringed instruments, each have been playing their instrument for an average of 25+ years, and we look forward to welcoming you into the StringWorks family. </p>
</ul>
